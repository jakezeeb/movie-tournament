# movie-tournament
This is my first large scale project in python and it is still very much so in its initial stages.

The end goal of this project is to create an app that would take submitted movie names from a group of users.  
These movies would then be put in a march madness type bracket and the users would vote on 1v1 matchups.
The intended use would be for a group trying to decide on what movie they want to watch.

In the longterm I would like to make it work with social media websites so data could be harvested on 
what movies certain demographics like more than others.
